# Project Title

- [x] This project fundamentals are based on cellular automata discrete model [x]

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## User stories

```
As a user
So that I know what is going on
I want to see a grid of cells

As a user
So I know the state of the cell
I want the cells to have different colours

As a user
So I can decide when the game begins
I want to be able to press a play button

As a user
So I can decide when the game ends
I want to be able to press a stop button

As a user
So I can decide when the game iterates
I want to be able to press a step button

As a user
So I can observe the simulation
I want it to follow Conway's Game of Life

As a user
So I can set the initial state
I want to be able to click on a cell to set it's state
```
