## User stories

```
As a user
So that I know what is going on
I want to see a grid of cells

As a user
So I know the state of the cell
I want the cells to have different colours

As a user
So I can decide when the game begins
I want to be able to press a play button

As a user
So I can decide when the game ends
I want to be able to press a stop button

As a user
So I can decide when the game iterates
I want to be able to press a step button

As a user
So I can observe the simulation
I want it to follow Conway's Game of Life

As a user
So I can set the initial state
I want to be able to click on a cell to set it's state
```
